But Santa really believes in “making spirits bright!” So he has planned a friendly competition among the elves to keep the Christmas cheer alive and make as many toys as possible! And the winning team gets a snow cone party! \\n\\nAs one of the team leaders, you know that nothing keeps your fellow elves more productive and motivated than a steady supply of candy canes! But all seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest are closed for revegetation, so the only ones available are stuck in the break room vending machines. And even though you receive free snacks on the job, the vending machines are always broken and don’t always give you what you want.\\n\\nDue to social distancing, only two elves can be in the break room at once. You and another team leader will take turns trying to get candy canes out of the 100 possible vending machines in the room, but each machine is unpredictable in how likely it is to work. You do know, however, that the more often you try to use a machine, the less likely it will give you a candy cane. Plus, you only have time to try 2000 times on the vending machines until you need to get back to the workshop! \\n\\nIf you can collect more candy canes than the other team leaders, you’ll surely be able to help your team win Santa\\u0027s contest! Try your hand at this multi-armed candy cane challenge!\\n\\nImage Credit: Photos by \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://unsplash.com/@joannakosinska?utm_source=unsplash\\u0026amp;utm_medium=referral\\u0026amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\\u0022\\u003eJoanna Kosinska\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href\\u0027=\\u0022https://unsplash.com/s/photos/misty-ladd\\u0022\\u003eMisty Ladd\\u003c/a\\u003e on Unsplash.\\n\",\"mimeType\":\"text/markdown\",\"name\":\"description\",\"isPublished\":false},\"rules\":{\"id\":114807,\"postId\":7821690,\"content\":\"**Effective Date**: December 8, 2020\\n\\n### COMPETITION TIMELINE\\nStart Date: December 8, 2020\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eMerger Deadline: February 1, 2021 11:59pm UTC\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eEntry Deadline: February 1, 2021 11:59pm UTC\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eFinal Submission Deadline: **February 1, 2021 11:59pm UTC** \\n\\nFinal Games Played: February 2 - February 9, 2021\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eEnd Date: February 9, 2021\\n\\n### COMPETITION-SPECIFIC TERMS\\n**COMPETITION TITLE**: Santa 2020 - The Candy Cane Contest\\n\\u003cbr\\u003e**COMPETITION SPONSOR**: Kaggle\\n\\u003cbr\\u003e**COMPETITION SPONSOR ADDRESS**: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, CA 94043\\n\\u003cbr\\u003e**COMPETITION WEBSITE**: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2020\\n\\u003cbr\\u003e**TOTAL PRIZES AVAILABLE**: Swag will be provided to the top five finishers as of the End Date\\n\\nWINNER LICENSE TYPE: None\\n\\u003cbr\\u003eDATA ACCESS AND USE: Competition-use only\\n\\nYour participation in this Competition is subject to the Kaggle’s Terms of Use, available at https://www.kaggle.com/terms, Kaggle’s Privacy Policy, available at https://www.kaggle.com/privacy, these competition rules, and any other terms, rules or restrictions on the Competition Website (collectively, the “Rules”).

In order to merge, (i) the combined team may not exceed the maximum team size; (ii) the total number of Submissions made by all the participants and the team may not exceed the number of Submissions allowed per day multiplied by the number of days the Competition has been running; and (iii) the combined team must meet all the requirements of these Rules. \\n \\nAll rules apply to a team as they would apply to an individual. For example, a team may make more than 2 Submissions per day. \\n \\n### TEAM LIMITS\\nThe maximum team size is 5.\\n \\n### SUBMISSIONS\\nTo be eligible for scoring and a position on the leaderboard, your submissions to the Competition (“Submissions”) must be made during the Competition Period, and in compliance with the Rules. Submissions may not be accepted or scored if they are in whole or part illegible, incomplete, damaged, altered, counterfeit, obtained through fraud, or late. \\n \\nYour Submission must be your own, original work such that you are the sole and exclusive owner and rights holder of the Submission, and that you have the right to make the Submission and grant all required licenses.\\n \\nIf open source code is used in the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.\\n \\n### SUBMISSION LIMITS\\nYou may submit a maximum of 5 Submissions per day.\\n \\n### SCORING AND LEADERBOARD\\nYour Submissions will be scored based on their performance in an episode, and your performances in episodes will be aggregated to determine your position on the leaderboard, in each case as described in the evaluation documentation on the Competition Website. \\n \\n### ENVIRONMENTS \\u0026 PUBLIC AVAILABILITY\\nThis Competition makes use of Kaggle Environments. Additional rules related to the Environment(s) used in this Competition are available on the Competition Website. A replay of each episode of the competition, which includes the actions taken by your Submission in the episode, may be publicly available and downloadable.\\n \\n### NO INGRESS OR EGRESS \\nDuring the evaluation of an episode your Submission may not pull in or use any information external to the Submission and Environment and may not send any information out. \\n\\n### DISQUALIFICATION\\nKaggle may disqualify any participant from the Competition if Kaggle reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition, for example, by cheating, violating the Rules, tampering with the submission process or any other part of the Competition or Competition Website, other unfair practices or abuses, or threatens or harasses any other participants or Kaggle. A disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle’s sole discretion.\\n \\n### RELEASE\\nKaggle makes no guarantees regarding, and you hereby release Kaggle from any liability associated with, operation of the Competition Website, including, for example, connection to the Website and the collection, processing, scoring, or retention of any Submission.\\n\\n### CHANGES TO THE COMPETITION \\nIf for any reason the Competition is not capable of running as planned, Kaggle may terminate, modify, or suspend the Competition. \\n \\n### CHANGES TO RULES\\nKaggle may modify these Rules or any additional terms that apply to the Competition to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Kaggle Services. You should look at the Rules regularly. Kaggle will post notice of modifications to these Official Competition Rules on this page and will post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Rules or terms for a service, you should discontinue your use of the Competition and that service.\\n\\n### NOT AN OFFER OR CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT\\nThe entry of a Submission or anything in these Rules is not an offer or contract of employment with Kaggle or any Kaggle affiliate.

But Santa really believes in “making spirits bright!” So he has planned a friendly competition among the elves to keep the Christmas cheer alive and make as many toys as possible! And the winning team gets a snow cone party! \\n\\nAs one of the team leaders, you know that nothing keeps your fellow elves more productive and motivated than a steady supply of candy canes! But all seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest are closed for revegetation, so the only ones available are stuck in the break room vending machines. And even though you receive free snacks on the job, the vending machines are always broken and don’t always give you what you want.\\n\\nDue to social distancing, only two elves can be in the break room at once. You and another team leader will take turns trying to get candy canes out of the 100 possible vending machines in the room, but each machine is unpredictable in how likely it is to work. You do know, however, that the more often you try to use a machine, the less likely it will give you a candy cane. Plus, you only have time to try 2000 times on the vending machines until you need to get back to the workshop! \\n\\nIf you can collect more candy canes than the other team leaders, you’ll surely be able to help your team win Santa\\u0027s contest! Try your hand at this multi-armed candy cane challenge!\\n\\nImage Credit: Photos by \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://unsplash.com/@joannakosinska?utm_source=unsplash\\u0026amp;utm_medium=referral\\u0026amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\\u0022\\u003eJoanna Kosinska\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href\\u0027=\\u0022https://unsplash.com/s/photos/misty-ladd\\u0022\\u003eMisty Ladd\\u003c/a\\u003e on Unsplash.\\n\",\"mimeType\":\"text/markdown\",\"name\":\"description\",\"isPublished\":true},{\"id\":114809,\"postId\":7865015,\"content\":\"Each day, your team is able to submit up to 5 agents (bots) to the competition. Each submission will play episodes (games) against other bots on the ladder that have a similar skill rating. Over time, skill ratings will go up with wins or down with losses. Every bot submitted will continue to play games until the end of the competition. On the leaderboard, only your best scoring bot will be shown, but you can track the progress of all of your submissions on your Submissions page.\\n\\nEach submission has an estimated skill rating which is modeled by a Gaussian N(μ,σ2) where μ is the estimated skill and σ represents our uncertainty of that estimate which will decrease over time.\\n\\nWhen you upload a submission, we first play a validation episode where that submission plays against copies of itself to make sure it works properly. If the episode fails, the submission is marked as error. Otherwise, we initialize the submission with μ0=600 and it joins the pool of all submissions for ongoing evaluation.\\n\\nWe repeatedly run episodes from the pool of all submissions and try to pick submissions with similar ratings for fair matches.

The agent with the most candy canes at the end wins the episode.\\n\\n## How To Play\\n\\nThis competition is modeled after the \\u0022multi-armed bandit problem,\\u0022 a classic probability-based, reinforcement learning problem that examines the exploration-exploitation tradeoff dilemma.\\n\\nIn this problem, both participants will work with the same set of 100 vending machines (bandits). Each bandit provides a random reward based on a probability distribution specific to that machine. Every round each player selects (\\u0022pulls\\u0022) a bandit, the likelihood of a reward decreases by 3%.\\n\\nEach agent can see the move of the other agent, but will not see whether a reward was gained in their respective bandit pull. \\n\\nThis episode continues for 2000 rounds per player (4000 pulls total).\\n\\n## Writing Agents\\n\\nAn Agent will receive an observation containing their total `reward`, the bandits pulled by both players in the previous turn (`lastActions`), the current `step` of the competition, and the `remainingOverageTime`.\\n\\nAn Agent should return the index of the bandit to be pulled.\\n\\nHere’s what that looks like as code: \\n\\n```\\n! pip install kaggle-environments --upgrade -q\\nimport random\\n\\ndef random_agent(observation, configuration):\\n    return random.randrange(configuration.banditCount)\\n```\\n\\n## Agent Rules\\n\\n1. Your Submission must be an “Agent”.\\n2. An Agent may only use any module from the Kaggle Kernels notebook image.\\n3. An Agent’s sole purpose is to generate an action. Activities/code which do not directly contribute to this will be considered malicious and handled according to the Rules.\\n4. An Agent can have a maximum file size limit of 100 MB.\\n5. An Agent must return an action within 0.25 second of being invoked. Agents have up to 60 seconds of overage time that can be spent on any step. Overage time is consumed automatically when an agent exceeds the per-step timeout. Agents are disqualified when their overage time reaches 0.\\n6. An Agent which throws errors or returns an invalid action will lose the episode and may be invalidated.\\n\\n### Evaluation\\nEach Submission has a rating which is modeled by a Gaussian \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal N (\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2)\\\\\\\\) where \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) is the estimated skill and \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\) represents our uncertainty of that estimate.\\n\\nWhen you upload a Submission, we first play a validation episode where that Submission plays against itself to make sure it works properly.  If the validation episode fails, the Submission is marked as “Error”.  Otherwise, we initialize the Submission with \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu_0 = 600\\\\\\\\) and it joins the pool of “All Submissions” for ongoing evaluation.\\n\\nWe run episodes with Submissions from the pool of All Submissions, and try to pick Submissions with similar ratings. We usually try to have each Submission participate in an episode a day, but the frequency may vary. After an episode finishes, we\\u0027ll update the rating for both Submissions.  If one Submission won the episode, we\\u0027ll increase its \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) and decrease its opponent\\u0027s \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) -- if the result of the episode was a draw, then we\\u0027ll move the two \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) values closer towards their mean.  The updates will have magnitude relative to the deviation from the expected result based on the previous \\\\\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\\\\\) values, and also relative to each Submission\\u0027s uncertainty \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\).  We also reduce the \\\\\\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\\\\\) terms relative to the amount of information gained by the result of the episode.\\n\\nSo all valid Submissions will continually play more matches and have dynamically changing scores as the pool increases.  The Leaderboard will show the rating of each team\\u0027s or participant’s (if that participant is not part of a team) best Submission.\\n\\n\",\"mimeType\":\"text/markdown\",\"name\":\"Environment Rules\",\"isPublished\":true},{\"id\":114883,\"postId\":7827192,\"content\":\"Kaggle-branded prizes (e.g. t-shirts, coffee mugs) will be provided to the top five finishers as of the End Date.\",\"mimeType\":\"text/markdown\",\"name\":\"Prizes\",\"isPublished\":true}],\"files\":null,\"databundleVersionId\":1762495,\"databundleVersions\":[],\"discussionTeaser\":[{\"title\":\"Thompson sampling with decay for non stationary reward.\",\"itemUrl\":\"/c/santa-2020/discussion/206375\",\"totalVotes\":1,\"totalReplies\":1,\"date\":\"2020-12-24T10:19:33.937Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"RobRomijnders\",\"userUrl\":\"/robromijnders\"},{\"title\":\"[Updated 12/17] Suggestions, Bugs, and Known Issues\",\"itemUrl\":\"/c/santa-2020/discussion/202225\",\"totalVotes\":0,\"totalReplies\":38,\"date\":\"2020-12-24T16:18:28.42Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"com_lock_cater\",\"userUrl\":\"/comlockcater\"},{\"title\":\"Looking for a Team Megathread\",\"itemUrl\":\"/c/santa-2020/discussion/202210\",\"totalVotes\":0,\"totalReplies\":6,\"date\":\"2020-12-24T17:28:49.493Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Bendesc\",\"userUrl\":\"/bendesc\"},{\"title\":\"So, err... anyone actually using RL?\",\"itemUrl\":\"/c/santa-2020/discussion/203261\",\"totalVotes\":0,\"totalReplies\":20,\"date\":\"2020-12-24T18:42:11.723Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"IsaiahP\",\"userUrl\":\"/pressman1\"},{\"title\":\"Using a trained RL model in submission.py\",\"itemUrl\":\"/c/santa-2020/discussion/203427\",\"totalVotes\":0,\"totalReplies\":6,\"date\":\"2020-12-25T17:29:00.087Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Bendesc\",\"userUrl\":\"/bendesc\"}],\"kernelTeaser\":[{\"title\":\"🎅 Merry Christmas!! 🎅\",\"itemUrl\":\"/subinium/merry-christmas\",\"totalVotes\":43,\"totalReplies\":0,\"date\":\"2020-12-26T01:12:59.167Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Subin An\",\"userUrl\":\"/subinium\"},{\"title\":\"Happy Christmas \",\"itemUrl\":\"/penchalaiah123/happy-christmas\",\"totalVotes\":1,\"totalReplies\":0,\"date\":\"2020-12-26T11:12:45.55Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Praveen Kumar\",\"userUrl\":\"/penchalaiah123\"},{\"title\":\"Basic-N-armed-Bandit\",\"itemUrl\":\"/paulrohan2020/basic-n-armed-bandit\",\"totalVotes\":5,\"totalReplies\":0,\"date\":\"2020-12-26T05:18:14.297Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Data Storm\",\"userUrl\":\"/paulrohan2020\"},{\"title\":\"Secret Santa With Python🎅| Merry Christmas!🎄\",\"itemUrl\":\"/utkarshxy/secret-santa-with-python-merry-christmas\",\"totalVotes\":8,\"totalReplies\":0,\"date\":\"2020-12-25T08:43:52.79Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"Utkarsh\",\"userUrl\":\"/utkarshxy\"},{\"title\":\"[1000+] Greedy Decision Tree model\",\"itemUrl\":\"/lebroschar/1000-greedy-decision-tree-model\",\"totalVotes\":14,\"totalReplies\":0,\"date\":\"2020-12-24T22:37:11.47Z\",\"userDisplayName\":\"lebroschar\",\"userUrl\":\"/lebroschar\"}],\"datasetVersions\":[],\"submissionsAreDisabled\":false,\"hasLeaderboard\":true,\"finalLeaderboardHasBeenVerified\":false,\"witholdFinalLeaderboardUntilItHasBeenVerified\":false,\"isPrivate\":false,\"publicLeaderboardMessage\":\"All valid submissions will continually play matches and have dynamically changing scores as the number of participants increases.
